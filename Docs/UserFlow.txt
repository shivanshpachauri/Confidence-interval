User Flow
User Inputs Data: Users enter their data into the DataInput component.

Calculation Trigger: On form submission, the app uses the useConfidenceInterval hook to calculate the confidence interval.

Display Results: The app then updates the Results and TrendChart components to visualize the data and the calculated confidence intervals.

Additional Considerations

Data Validation: Ensure robust validation for user inputs to prevent errors in calculations.

Error Handling: Handle potential errors gracefully (e.g., no data provided).

Styling: Use CSS or a UI framework like Material-UI for responsive design.

This structure should give you a solid foundation for developing a React app
 utilizes confidence intervals to predict trends and behaviors effectively!
